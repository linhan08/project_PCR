### Running the seed or final project

* To get started with the seed project, [clone this repo](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-dynamic-forms/tree/seed).

* To run the final project, [clone this repo](https://github.com/toddmotto/angular-dynamic-forms).

Once you've cloned the repo, install all the dependencies by running:

```bash
yarn install

# OR

npm install
```

You can then dive straight into coding by running:

```bash
yarn start

# OR

npm start
```

This will start up webpack and a local development server at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
